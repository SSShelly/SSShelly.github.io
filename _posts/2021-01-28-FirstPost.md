ok now I will try something new for me.
#THE FIRST POST
yes,right,that's it.
`Hey!Github!`

##The Vacaiton
This is the 28th day of my **winter vacation** and I had kept for coding for `two weeks`.

yea,the first week I have a sweet trip with my *boyfriendðŸ’•*.Then I backed to my hometown.I missed her so much.
My university is **far away from my hometownðŸ˜¢**.Going home means a lot to me.
I found my 8-year-sister *understand much more* while my parents *looks older*.

Whatever,I need to do more with my computer.My baby computer.
I cannot just lay in bed like some other college students,stay up late playing phones and just get up for the meals.
**NO.**
I won't be a junk.I think.

I'm a sophomore who major in **Big data**.
If you choose to study computer,that means you should knock keyboard as far as possible.
These days I read many data,and I *am sure* I want to be a postgraduate student in the coming years.

> That's why I'm here and typing these.
> I WANT A **BRIGHT FUTURE**.
> AND I **WONT** BE **A LOSER**.
